## Introduction

Project 4: SafeComm Digital Security Solutions focuses on developing a predictive model to identify fraudulent SMS messages. The aim is to enhance digital security and safeguard users by filtering potential scams or fraudulent activities conveyed through text messages. 

## Methods

Our approach encompassed preprocessing the dataset, which included one-hot encoding of categorical features, TF-IDF vectorization of text data, and standardization of numerical features. We chose Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms for their distinct advantages and suitability to binary classification problems. The environment was set up using Python with libraries such as scikit-learn for model training and evaluation. To replicate the environment, one could use a conda environment with the necessary packages listed in a requirements.txt or environment.yml file.

## Experimental Design

The experiments were designed to evaluate model performance in classifying SMS messages as fraudulent or not. We compared our models against a baseline accuracy of random guessing, proportionate to class distribution. The evaluation metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as these metrics provide a comprehensive view of model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.

##Results

The Logistic Regression model emerged as the most suitable, achieving a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We obtained perfect scores across all evaluation metrics, which suggests an overfitting to the training data or an oversimplified problem setup. Results were tabulated and visualized using matplotlib and seaborn to present the performance of each model directly from the code.

##Conclusions

In conclusion, while our models achieved high performance, the perfect scores across the board indicate a need for further validation against unseen data or potential model adjustments to prevent overfitting. Future work could involve deploying the model into a real-world setting for A/B testing with live data, diversifying the dataset, and exploring more complex models or ensemble methods to understand the modelâ€™s behavior in more nuanced scenarios.
